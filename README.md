General info
My project is a phrase game. A user will choose letters to complete the phrases. If the user guesses correctly, the letter changes to blue, if they guess incorrectly, the letter changes to pink and loses a heart. After completing the phrases, the background will change red for a loss and green for a win. there will be a win or lose message appear at the end to celebrate or try again. 

The purpose of my project, is to complete all phrases and keep your hearts.

My motivation is completing a simple game for users to have fun.
